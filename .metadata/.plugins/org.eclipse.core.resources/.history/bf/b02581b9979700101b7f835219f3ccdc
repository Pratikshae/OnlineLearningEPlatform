			⏳ Cancellation Window: Students can request course cancellation within 7 days of enrollment for a partial refund.
								
			💰 Refund Amount: A processing fee of 20% will be deducted, and the remaining amount refunded within 7–10 business days.
								
			🚫 Non-Refundable: After 7 days, fees become non-refundable due to resource allocation and faculty scheduling.
								
			🔄 Course Transfer: Instead of cancellation, learners may transfer enrollment to another batch/course (subject to availability).
								
			📧 Request Process: Cancellation or transfer requests must be submitted via email to support@[InstituteDomain].com with enrollment details.
