	    Welcome to Prat's Coding Training Institute
		Institute, a trusted platform where knowledge meets innovation and
		learning transforms into opportunity. Founded with the vision of
		empowering individuals through accessible and high-quality education,
		our institute has become a leading destination for students, working
		professionals, and lifelong learners. At EduGrowth, we believe that
		education is not just about acquiring knowledge but also about
		building confidence, enhancing skills, and preparing for the future.

		Our journey began with a simple idea — to bridge the gap between
		traditional education and the rapidly changing digital world. Today,
		we proudly offer a wide range of online training programs covering
		technology, business, data science, digital marketing, languages, and
		personal development. Each program is carefully designed by industry
		experts and experienced educators who bring real-world insights into
		the virtual classroom. With interactive sessions, practical
		assignments, and personalized mentoring, our learners gain not just
		theoretical knowledge but also the hands-on skills required in their
		professional careers. What sets us apart is our student-first
		approach. We understand that every learner has unique needs, goals,
		and learning styles. That’s why we offer flexible schedules, recorded
		sessions, live discussions, and doubt-clearing forums to ensure that
		no student is left behind. Our advanced learning management system
		(LMS) allows learners to track progress, access resources anytime, and
		stay engaged with the community. EduGrowth has trained thousands of
		students globally, many of whom are now thriving in leading companies,
		startups, and entrepreneurial ventures. The institute’s commitment to
		excellence, affordability, and inclusivity makes it an ideal choice
		for anyone seeking to upgrade skills or start a new career path.
		Beyond academics, we focus on holistic growth — providing guidance on
		soft skills, interview preparation, and career counseling. Our mission
		is simple yet powerful: ✅ To make quality education accessible to
		everyone, anywhere. ✅ To continuously update and innovate our
		curriculum to match industry standards. ✅ To build a supportive and
		inspiring community of learners and mentors. At EduGrowth, we don’t
		just deliver courses; we shape futures. Whether you’re a beginner
		taking the first step into a new field or a professional aiming to
		sharpen your expertise, our institute is here to guide you every step
		of the way. Together, let’s unlock your potential and create a
		brighter tomorrow.
